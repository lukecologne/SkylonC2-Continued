Usage:

Skylon Control Core 2 has an animation that allows you to change the "Control from here" vector between the Sabre engine thrust vector, and the orbital engine thrust vector. This will change where the navball is pointing to be in line with the corresponding engines. The Sabre vector is selected by default.

Skylon Control Core 1 is a regular part. Selecting "Control from here" on this part will let you control the craft easier with the RCS thrusters since they are aligned with that part.

The included craft file has all the parts and action groups set up as follows:
- The control surfaces are set to use specific user input
- Main landing gear has the brakes on by default
- Sabre engines are set to Manual Switching. 
- AG 1 set to change Sabre engine mode
- AG 2 set to toggle Sabre engines
- AG 3 set to toggle the Skylon Orbital Maneuvering Assembly

In order to perform a successful launch with the Skylon you need to do the following.
1. Load the included craft file and launch
2. Right-click on the Skylon Control Core 2 and click "Control from here". 
3. SAS on, Breaks off.
4. Stage.
5. Towards the end of the runway pitch up as far as you can without destroying the tail.
6. As soon as you leave the runway, pitch up more to start gaining altitude and retract the landing gear to decrease drag.
7. Fly in air-breathing mode to about 20km and accelerate to about 900-1000m/s. Watch your IntakeAir.
8. Switch to rocket mode, and continue as you would with a rocket. The craft has enough resources to achieve an orbit of ~300km with a heavy payload.
9. If you want to use the SOMA engine you must change the vector on the Skylon Control Core 2.
10. If you have a dockable payload in the payload bay and you want to dock using RCS, you need to click "Control from here" on Skylon Control Core 1.
11. Remember to switch back to the correct core and vector before returning to Kerbin.
